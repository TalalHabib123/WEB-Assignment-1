 Web Assignment 1 Web Page
  Using the given design, we were required to create a webpage that takes a JSON file of Job Listings and displays it on the front end.
  In addition to this we were to create an Add Button to include new jobs and a delete button to delete any job from the front end.
  Also Upon clicking the job card an Pop Up screen should display the Job details.
